# Text direction
Someone said "hey - how cool would it be if we supported a language that had right to left text, like Hebrew?"

/shrug

I dunno.  Very cool?

So I had no idea how to do this, and I made a thing to see if it'd be easy.  

## Install
1) `git clone` the repo
2) `yarn install`
3) `yarn start`

The app will spin up on `localhost:3000`.  Admire the total lack of style and click the button change the text direction.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
